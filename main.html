              Happy Birthday, my love. Today, as I think of you, I canâ€™t help but smile remembering our old school days.  
              <br><br>
              Those moments when I used to <em>peep into your class</em> just to catch a glimpse of you on my way to the washroomâ€”<strong>those little stolen seconds</strong> were the highlight of my day.  
              <br><br>
              Back then, seeing you every day felt so natural, and now, being apart, I realize just <strong>how much those moments</strong> meant to me.  
              <br><br>
              I miss those carefree days, but even now, every memory of us reminds me of how special you are.  
              <br><br>
              Youâ€™ve always been the <span class="highlight">most beautiful part of my life</span>, and Iâ€™m so grateful to have you. I love you more than ever, and I canâ€™t wait until we can make more memories together.  
              <br><br>
              Happy Birthday, my everything. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’–

      My dearest, words can't even begin to express how much you mean to me. From the very first moment we met, I knew my life had changed forever. Your love, your unwavering support, and the kindness you've shown me have made all the difference in my world.
      <br><br>
      Every day with you feels like a gift, and I am truly grateful for the love you give me. You've always been there for me, through every up and down, and for that, I will always be thankful.
      <br><br>
      I know I haven't been able to show my appreciation as much as I would like, but soon, I will give you a gift that I hope you will like. I can't wait to see you again.
      <br><br>
      I love you more than words can express, and I look forward to the day when we can create more beautiful memories together.
      <br><br>
      With all my love,
      <br>
